## Development

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed

Once you have it installed, cd into the folder and do the following.

1. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

2. Run watch server
```
npm run watch
```



### IDE

Use of an IDE is encouraged. If you decided to use one, make sure to use Webstorm or IntelliJ Ultimate (instead of the free Community Edition).

1. You need to install the following plugins:
  * Node.js
  * EJS

2. Setup your IDE for Node.js development.
  * [Configure Node.js in IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/node-js.html#nodeInterpreter)
  * [Setup Run configurations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-npm-scripts.html#d701601e246) (Note: under "scripts" of run configuration, type "watch")
